# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Alexis Hoshino

Both historically and now, cluttered writing and speech do more harm than good and have been used to signify status or veil truth from public understanding. They have many forms, and often reflect a cluttered mind. Though clutter and excess have widespread popularity and may come as second nature to many, writers should instead strive to make every word do work. Imagining the reader has a 30 second attention span, the writer should get to the point immediately. Succinct writing requires alertness, multiple drafts, and is no easy task but it is worthwhile.
